# js-course-pig-game
This is a game created by me, using the course "The Complete JavaScript Course 2024: From Zero to Expert!" From Udemy.

In this course I used what I've used the basics in Javascript, HTML and CSS to create a quick game where the object is to reach the maximun score of 100 by rolling a d6 that will get the value and add to a temporary score until the player clicks to hold it to add it to his main score, or he rolls a 1 that will reset his temporary score to ), will not add anything to main score, and switch to the second player's turn.

The game can be found working on the site:[https://maxrabbitdesign.com/projects/Pig-Game/](https://maxrabbitdesign.com/projects/Pig-Game/)
